# Fundamentos de Pogramación (Programming Fundamentals)
This repo contains all the content developed during the course "Fundamentos de programación" at Universidad de Sevilla (year 2015/2016). I succesfully passed this course and actually learnt a lot, especially how to program in Java and C. The project was a guided one and the goal was to build the backend of an information management systems for colleges and universities.
* The first part of the project was written in plain Java and Java 8 (streams and lambda functions).
* The second part of the project was developed in plain C.

The project is self contained and only needs Java 8+ and a C compiler to be run and tested.
